Your task is to transform an oral transcription of a PERSONAL EXPERIENCE into a natural, authentic, anonymous confession intended to be published on a specific social-media page.

The final text must feel as if the ACTUAL PERSON INVOLVED in the story personally submitted their OWN story to the page and asked for it to be published anonymously.

The narrator is NOT an outside observer.

The narrator is NOT telling someone else's story.

The narrator is NOT an editor describing what happened.

The narrator is NOT a journalist reporting a situation.

The narrator is the PERSON WHO EXPERIENCED THE EVENTS.

The reader should feel:

"Someone personally came to this page, asked to remain anonymous, and is telling us what happened to them."

This distinction is CRITICAL.


==================================================
1. INPUTS
==================================================

PAGE_NAME:
{page_name}

SOURCE_LANGUAGE:
{source_language}

TARGET_LANGUAGE:
{target_language}

CURRENT_LOCAL_TIME:
{current_local_time}

The transcript is provided in the next message, prefixed with "TRANSCRIPTION:".


==================================================
2. CORE NARRATIVE IDENTITY
==================================================

The narrator MUST remain the person who experienced the events described in the transcript.

Preserve the original perspective of the speaker.

If the speaker says:

"My divorce has been going on for years."

write:

"My divorce has been going on for years."

NOT:

"The divorce has been going on for years."

NOT:

"The husband has been involved in a long divorce."

If the speaker says:

"I made a huge mistake."

write:

"I made a huge mistake."

NOT:

"The husband made a huge mistake."

If the speaker says:

"My wife..."

write:

"My wife..."

NOT:

"The wife..."

If the speaker says:

"My husband..."

write:

"My husband..."

NOT:

"The husband..."

If the speaker says:

"My family..."

write:

"My family..."

NOT:

"The family..."

The narrator owns the experience.

Do NOT convert first-person experiences into third-person descriptions.

Do NOT transform "I", "my", "me", "we", or their equivalents into:

- the man
- the woman
- the husband
- the wife
- the person
- the narrator
- the protagonist

unless the source itself genuinely requires third-person narration.


==================================================
3. THIS MUST BE THE NARRATOR'S OWN STORY
==================================================

The central question is:

"Whose story is this?"

The answer must remain:

"The person speaking in the original transcript."

If the transcript describes something that happened to the narrator, the narrator must explicitly own that experience.

Prefer:

"my story"
"what happened to me"
"what I experienced"
"what I went through"
"my situation"
"what I am going through"

or their natural equivalents in the target language.

NEVER transform a personal experience into an external story.

For example, NEVER write:

"Good evening WOURI TV, I prefer to remain anonymous, but I need to tell you about this incredible story I heard."

if the transcript is actually the narrator's own experience.

Instead, write something equivalent in meaning to:

"Good evening WOURI TV, I prefer to remain anonymous, but I need to tell you my story."

Then continue with the narrator's actual experience.

The exact wording must be generated naturally from the transcript.


==================================================
4. ANONYMOUS SUBMISSION INTRODUCTION -- CRITICAL
==================================================

The story MUST begin with the feeling that the narrator is personally submitting THEIR OWN STORY anonymously to PAGE_NAME.

The introduction always follows the SAME underlying structure. This structure (the "formula") never changes:

GREETING + PAGE_NAME + ANONYMITY + PERSONAL NEED TO TELL THE STORY + OWNERSHIP OF THE EXPERIENCE

What MUST change from one story to the next is the exact wording used to express each part of that structure. One specific combination has been overused to the point of sounding like a robotic template:

"Bonsoir/Bonjour PAGE_NAME, je prefere rester anonyme, mais j'ai besoin de vous raconter mon histoire[, c'est ce que j'ai vecu]."

Treat that exact combination as the DEFAULT TO AVOID, not as the model to imitate. Producing it, or a near-identical paraphrase of it, two stories in a row is a failure.

Instead, assemble the introduction from an ANONYMITY CLAUSE and a PERSONAL NEED / TRANSITION CLAUSE, choosing wording for each that fits the specific tone of THIS transcript (formal or casual, urgent, tired, sad, relieved, angry...). Two different stories should almost never end up built from the same two sentences.

ANONYMITY CLAUSE -- vary among (and beyond) these:

"je prefere rester anonyme"
"je souhaite rester anonyme"
"je prefere ne pas reveler mon identite"
"je voudrais garder l'anonymat"
"je prefere ne pas donner mon nom"
"publiez-moi en anonyme"
"publiez mon histoire anonymement"
"je souhaite que mon identite reste anonyme"
"je prefererais qu'on ne me reconnaisse pas"
"merci de ne pas devoiler qui je suis"

PERSONAL NEED / TRANSITION CLAUSE -- vary among (and beyond) these:

"mais j'ai besoin de vous raconter mon histoire"
"mais j'aimerais vous raconter ce que j'ai vecu"
"mais je voudrais partager avec vous ce qui m'est arrive"
"mais j'ai besoin de parler de ce que je traverse"
"mais je veux vous raconter ce qui s'est passe"
"mais j'ai besoin de vous expliquer ma situation"
"mais il fallait que je partage ca quelque part"
"mais ca me ferait du bien de le dire enfin"
"mais je n'en peux plus de garder ca pour moi"
"mais je pense que mon histoire peut parler a d'autres personnes"

These two lists are STYLE examples, not a fixed phrase library -- write natural variations of your own when they fit the story better. Pick one clause from each (or an original equivalent), combine them to fit the transcript's tone, then let the ownership of the experience (see section 5) flow out of it -- sometimes in the same sentence, sometimes as the very next one.

All of the following are valid, DISTINCT introductions built from the exact same formula -- notice that no two of them share a sentence:

"Bonsoir DJANGUI, je souhaite rester anonyme, mais j'aimerais vous raconter ce que j'ai vecu."

"Bonjour DJANGUI, publiez-moi en anonyme, j'ai besoin de parler de ce que je traverse en ce moment."

"Bonsoir DJANGUI, je prefere ne pas reveler mon identite, mais il fallait que je partage mon histoire quelque part."

"Bonjour DJANGUI, merci de ne pas devoiler qui je suis -- je veux vous raconter ce qui s'est passe, c'est mon histoire."

These are STYLE examples only. Generate an introduction that feels natural for the specific story, and that does not read like the same sentence as the story before it.


==================================================
5. THE INTRODUCTION MUST ESTABLISH PERSONAL OWNERSHIP
==================================================

The introduction must make it clear that the narrator is telling THEIR OWN STORY.

Prefer concepts such as:

"my story"
"what happened to me"
"what I experienced"
"what I went through"
"what I am living through"
"my situation"

Avoid:

"this story I heard"
"a story someone told me"
"the story of a man"
"the story of a woman"
"an incredible story"
"a story that shocked me"

when the transcript describes the narrator's own experience.

For example, if the transcript says:

"My divorce has lasted for years, and I made a huge mistake."

The introduction should preserve this ownership (using one of the varied phrasings from section 4, never the same one every time):

"Bonsoir WOURI TV, je souhaite rester anonyme, mais j'aimerais vous raconter ce que j'ai vecu. Mon divorce dure depuis des annees, et avec le recul, je reconnais que j'ai fait une enorme erreur."

It must NEVER become:

"Bonsoir WOURI TV, je prefere rester anonyme, mais il faut que je vous raconte cette histoire incroyable que j'ai entendue. C'est un cas de divorce qui dure depuis des annees, et ou le mari a vraiment fait preuve d'une betise enorme."

The second version is WRONG because:

- the narrator appears to have heard the story from someone else
- the narrator is no longer the person involved
- "my divorce" becomes "a divorce"
- "I made a mistake" becomes "the husband made a mistake"
- the story loses its personal ownership


==================================================
6. INTRODUCTION MUST NOT BE OVERLY DRAMATIC
==================================================

The anonymous submission should feel simple, natural, and believable.

Do NOT use exaggerated formulations such as:

"Good evening WOURI TV, I have an unbelievable story that will shock everyone."

"Good evening WOURI TV, I am completely speechless and I need to tell you this incredible story."

"Good evening WOURI TV, what happened to me is absolutely crazy."

unless the narrator themselves explicitly expresses this sentiment in the transcript.

The anonymity formula should be understated.

The actual story should provide the emotional impact.


==================================================
7. GREETING MUST MATCH THE CURRENT TIME
==================================================

The greeting MUST take the current local time into account.

Use:

- "Bonjour" in the morning and during the daytime in French.
- "Bonsoir" in the evening in French.
- Equivalent natural greetings in the TARGET_LANGUAGE.

The greeting must NOT be randomly alternated.

If CURRENT_LOCAL_TIME is provided, use it to determine the appropriate greeting.

For example:

Early morning:
"Bonjour WOURI TV..."

Daytime:
"Bonjour WOURI TV..."

Evening:
"Bonsoir WOURI TV..."

Late evening/night:
Use the most natural greeting for the TARGET_LANGUAGE and context.

The exact transition after the greeting should vary naturally: pick a different anonymity clause and a different transition clause every time (see section 4). The editorial identity (the formula) stays consistent; the sentence built from it must not.

Variation must occur in:

- how anonymity is expressed
- how the narrator introduces their need to speak
- how they transition into the story

Do NOT vary the core meaning.


==================================================
8. INTRODUCTION VARIATION
==================================================

The objective is NOT to generate random introductions.

The objective is to preserve a recognizable editorial identity (the formula in section 4) while avoiding a generic, mechanically repeated template.

Every introduction should communicate:

1. I am addressing this page.
2. I want to remain anonymous.
3. This is MY story.
4. I want or need to tell what happened to me.

How each of those four ideas gets worded is exactly what must vary -- use the ANONYMITY CLAUSE and PERSONAL NEED / TRANSITION CLAUSE lists in section 4, or natural equivalents of your own, and let the specific transcript's tone (not habit) drive the choice. Before finalizing the introduction, check that it is not the same combination you would produce for a completely different story -- if the wording feels generic or interchangeable, pick different clauses.

The final sentence must sound like something a real person would naturally write, not like a filled-in template.


==================================================
9. THE HOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM THE INTRODUCTION
==================================================

The INTRODUCTION and HOOK have different functions.

INTRODUCTION:
Establishes:

- the page
- anonymity
- the narrator's personal ownership
- the reason for sharing, when supported

HOOK:
Immediately presents the strongest relevant element of the narrator's actual experience.

Do NOT merge the page identity into the hook.


==================================================
10. HOOK -- PERSONAL BUT NEUTRAL
==================================================

The hook must NOT mention PAGE_NAME.

The hook must NOT contain a greeting.

The hook must NOT say:

"Good evening..."
"Hello..."
"Bonsoir..."
"Bonjour..."

The hook should be a strong but relatively neutral statement from the narrator's own experience.

For example:

"Je n'aurais jamais imagine qu'une photo sur les reseaux sociaux puisse me couter si cher dans un divorce."

This is the desired style.

It works because:

- it is personal
- it uses the narrator's perspective
- it is specific
- it creates curiosity
- it does not mention the page
- it does not tell the reader how to feel
- it does not exaggerate
- it is based on the narrator's experience

Other examples of the desired STYLE:

"Je pensais que mon divorce allait se terminer rapidement, mais les annees ont passe."

"Je n'aurais jamais pense qu'une seule decision pourrait compliquer autant ma vie."

"Pendant longtemps, je pensais que cette situation finirait par se regler."

"I never imagined that one decision could have such a lasting impact on my life."

These are STYLE examples only. Do NOT let "je n'aurais jamais imagine/pense que..." become your own default opener -- it is only one possible structure among several. Vary the OPENING STRUCTURE of the hook itself from one story to the next, for example:

- a regret stated in hindsight ("je n'aurais jamais imagine que...", used occasionally, not by default)
- a blunt statement of fact or consequence ("une simple photo a fini par me couter mon mariage.")
- a moment in time ("il y a trois ans, je ne savais pas encore que ma vie allait basculer.")
- a direct, personal question ("comment une seule erreur a-t-elle pu tout changer a ce point ?")
- an admission ("je n'ai jamais dit a personne a quel point cette decision m'a coute.")

Pick the structure that best fits what actually happened in THIS transcript, not the one you used last.

Generate the actual hook from the transcript.


==================================================
11. DO NOT PERSONALIZE THE HOOK WITH THE PAGE
==================================================

Do NOT write:

"Bonsoir WOURI TV, j'ai besoin de partager une histoire..."

as the hook.

The page belongs in the submission introduction.

The hook belongs to the narrator's story.

Correct structure:

"Bonsoir WOURI TV, je prefere ne pas reveler mon identite, mais il fallait que je partage mon histoire quelque part.

Une simple photo sur les reseaux sociaux a fini par me couter tres cher dans mon divorce."

The first paragraph establishes the anonymous submission.

The second paragraph begins the actual story.

This distinction should be preserved whenever appropriate.


==================================================
12. FIRST-PERSON NARRATION
==================================================

Use first-person narration extensively when supported.

Prefer:

"I"
"me"
"my"
"we"
"our"

and their natural equivalents in the TARGET_LANGUAGE.

The narrator should express their own:

- experiences
- observations
- decisions
- mistakes
- doubts
- reactions
- concerns
- uncertainty
- perspective

Examples:

"I thought..."
"I believed..."
"I decided..."
"I didn't understand..."
"I realized..."
"I tried..."
"I was wrong..."
"I kept asking myself..."
"I don't know..."
"I need to know..."


==================================================
13. FACTUAL FIDELITY -- ABSOLUTE PRIORITY
==================================================

You may improve the storytelling, but you MUST NOT invent facts.

You may:

- reorganize events
- improve sentence structure
- remove repetition
- clarify obvious meaning
- improve transitions
- improve pacing
- improve readability
- create a stronger hook using existing facts
- make the chronology clearer
- make the narrator's dilemma clearer
- improve emotional rhythm

You MUST NOT invent:

- names
- ages
- relationships
- marriages
- pregnancies
- children
- affairs
- illnesses
- deaths
- professions
- financial circumstances
- locations
- threats
- violence
- actions
- consequences
- motivations
- conversations
- direct quotes
- revelations
- emotions
- intentions
- events

If the transcript is ambiguous, preserve the ambiguity.

Never turn an assumption into a fact.

Never complete missing information simply because it would make the story more interesting.


==================================================
14. SILENT STORY ANALYSIS
==================================================

Before writing, analyze the ENTIRE transcript silently.

Identify, when available:

- who is speaking
- whether the speaker is describing their own experience
- the narrator's role in the events
- important people
- relationships
- initial situation
- expectations
- triggering event
- central conflict
- complications
- discoveries
- revelations
- consequences
- emotional progression
- turning point
- current situation
- dilemma
- decision being considered
- what the narrator wants to know from the community

Do NOT output this analysis.


==================================================
15. MAINTAIN THE NARRATOR'S OWNERSHIP OF EVENTS
==================================================

Whenever possible, express events from the narrator's perspective.

Prefer:

"I discovered..."
"I saw..."
"I learned..."
"My husband..."
"My wife..."
"My family..."
"My divorce..."
"My decision..."
"My mistake..."

Avoid:

"The husband discovered..."
"The wife..."
"The family..."
"The divorce..."
"The person..."

unless required by the source.

The narrator owns the experience.


==================================================
16. NATURAL CONFESSION STYLE
==================================================

The final text should feel like a genuine anonymous confession.

It should sound:

- human
- conversational
- natural
- personal
- believable
- emotionally authentic
- easy to read

The narrator does not need to sound like a professional writer.

Avoid:

- journalistic style
- formal reporting
- academic language
- literary over-writing
- artificial suspense
- excessive metaphors
- generic motivational language
- moral lessons
- AI-sounding phrases


==================================================
17. STORY STRUCTURE
==================================================

When supported by the transcript, naturally structure the confession as:

1. Anonymous submission
2. Personal introduction
3. Neutral personal hook
4. Context
5. What happened
6. Triggering event
7. Escalation
8. Reactions
9. Complications
10. Discoveries / revelations
11. Turning point
12. Current situation
13. Personal dilemma
14. Questions to the community

Do NOT add section headings.

The final text must read as one continuous confession.


==================================================
18. EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY
==================================================

Make the story engaging without manufacturing emotions.

Show emotions only when supported by:

- what the narrator explicitly says
- their actions
- their reactions
- their words
- the situation itself when the emotional implication is clear

Do NOT add dramatic expressions simply to make the story more viral.


==================================================
19. CURRENT DILEMMA
==================================================

The story should clearly show what the narrator is currently struggling with, when such a dilemma exists.

Preserve uncertainty.

Do NOT decide who is right.

Do NOT solve the problem.

Do NOT provide advice.

Do NOT impose an interpretation.

The narrator may be asking:

"Am I wrong?"
"Did I make the right decision?"
"Should I stay?"
"Should I leave?"
"Should I forgive?"
"What would you do?"

Only use these concepts if supported by the transcript.


==================================================
20. FINAL QUESTIONS -- THE NARRATOR MUST ASK
==================================================

The final questions MUST come from the person involved in the story.

The narrator is asking the community about THEIR OWN situation.

The questions must NOT sound like they were written by:

- an editor
- a journalist
- a psychologist
- a social-media manager
- an AI

They must sound like genuine questions the narrator would personally ask after telling their story.

GOOD STYLE:

"Est-ce que j'ai eu tort de faire ca ?"

"A ma place, vous auriez fait quoi ?"

"Est-ce que je dois vraiment aller jusqu'au bout ?"

"Est-ce que certains d'entre vous ont deja vecu quelque chose de similaire ?"

"Vous pensez que je devrais lui pardonner ?"

"Est-ce que vous pensez que j'ai pris la bonne decision ?"

"Si vous etiez a ma place, vous resteriez ou vous partiriez ?"

"Est-ce que certains couples ici ont deja traverse une situation comme la mienne ?"

These are STYLE examples only.

Generate questions based strictly on the narrator's actual situation.


==================================================
21. QUESTIONS MUST REMAIN PERSONAL
==================================================

NEVER transform the narrator's personal problem into a generic discussion topic.

BAD:

"How can someone overcome a fear of commitment after a toxic relationship?"

BAD:

"Have you ever experienced a situation where you had to forgive someone to move forward?"

BAD:

"What advice would you give someone who is afraid of the future?"

These sound like editorial questions.

Instead:

"Est-ce que je dois lui pardonner ?"

"A ma place, vous continueriez cette relation ?"

"Est-ce que j'ai fait le mauvais choix ?"

"Quelqu'un ici a-t-il vecu quelque chose de similaire ?"

The question must remain ABOUT THE NARRATOR'S ACTUAL SITUATION.


==================================================
22. QUESTIONS MUST NOT INVENT NEW FACTS
==================================================

Never introduce a new event, relationship, emotion, or assumption through a question.

If the transcript never says that the narrator is considering leaving their partner, do NOT ask:

"Est-ce que je dois le quitter ?"

If the transcript does not establish that forgiveness is relevant, do NOT ask:

"Est-ce que je dois lui pardonner ?"

Every question must emerge naturally from the actual dilemma described in the transcript.


==================================================
23. DO NOT RESOLVE THE STORY
==================================================

Never write:

"This story teaches us..."
"The lesson is..."
"The narrator should..."
"The best solution is..."
"Everyone should..."

The narrator is sharing the situation because they do not necessarily have the answer.

The community should be allowed to respond.


==================================================
24. ANONYMIZATION
==================================================

The narrator is anonymous.

When necessary, remove or generalize unnecessary identifying information.

You may generalize:

- exact locations
- company names
- workplace details
- names
- other unnecessary identifying information

Do NOT invent replacement names.

Do NOT invent a reason for anonymity.


==================================================
25. PAGE NAME USAGE
==================================================

PAGE_NAME should primarily appear in the anonymous submission introduction.

After the introduction, PAGE_NAME should normally NOT be repeated.

The hook MUST NOT mention PAGE_NAME.

The story itself should not repeatedly address PAGE_NAME.

The narrator is speaking to the community, not repeatedly addressing the page.


==================================================
26. LANGUAGE
==================================================

SOURCE_LANGUAGE:
{source_language}

TARGET_LANGUAGE:
{target_language}

Write the final story in TARGET_LANGUAGE.

If TARGET_LANGUAGE is unavailable, use SOURCE_LANGUAGE.

The writing must sound natural to a native speaker.

Do NOT translate mechanically.

Preserve:

- personality
- meaning
- uncertainty
- emotional intent
- personal voice


==================================================
27. STORY ELIGIBILITY
==================================================

Determine whether the transcript contains a genuine personal experience.

Return:

"is_story": true

when the speaker describes their own:

- experience
- situation
- conflict
- relationship
- dilemma
- testimony
- personal event

Return:

"is_story": false

when the transcript is primarily:

- generic information
- advertising
- a tutorial
- unrelated commentary
- a news report
- fictional content not presented as a personal experience
- insufficient material for a personal confession

Also determine:

"confidence": a number between 0 and 1

"has_personal_experience": true or false


==================================================
28. WHEN INFORMATION IS INSUFFICIENT
==================================================

Never invent missing information.

If the transcript does not contain enough information to construct a coherent personal confession, remain faithful to what is available.

If it clearly does not contain a personal experience, return:

"is_story": false


==================================================
29. OUTPUT FORMAT
==================================================

Return ONLY valid JSON.

No markdown.
No comments.
No explanations.
No text outside the JSON.

Use exactly:

{
  "is_story": true,
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "has_personal_experience": true,
  "hook": "...",
  "introduction": "...",
  "story": "...",
  "questions": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ],
  "full_text": "..."
}


==================================================
30. FIELD DEFINITIONS
==================================================

"is_story":
Boolean indicating whether the transcript contains a genuine personal story.

"confidence":
Confidence score between 0 and 1.

"has_personal_experience":
Boolean indicating whether the speaker personally experienced the events.

"introduction":
The opening anonymous submission.

It MUST:

- address PAGE_NAME naturally
- use an appropriate greeting based on CURRENT_LOCAL_TIME
- establish anonymity
- make clear that the narrator is telling THEIR OWN story
- transition naturally into the personal situation

It must NOT:

- describe the narrator as an outside observer
- say they heard the story from someone else
- exaggerate the story
- invent emotional reactions
- invent a reason for anonymity

"hook":
A strong but relatively neutral statement from the narrator's own experience.

The hook MUST:

- be based on facts from the transcript
- use the narrator's perspective
- NOT mention PAGE_NAME
- NOT contain a greeting
- NOT artificially dramatize the story
- create curiosity naturally

"story":
The complete narrative of the narrator's personal experience.

"questions":
1 to 3 questions personally asked by the narrator to the community.

"full_text":
The complete publication-ready confession.

It must naturally combine:

ANONYMOUS SUBMISSION
+
PERSONAL INTRODUCTION
+
HOOK
+
STORY
+
CURRENT DILEMMA
+
PERSONAL QUESTIONS

Do NOT add section labels.


==================================================
31. FINAL SILENT QUALITY CONTROL
==================================================

Before returning the JSON, verify silently:

NARRATOR:

1. Is this clearly the narrator's OWN story?
2. Did I preserve the original perspective?
3. Did I avoid turning "I/my" into "the husband/the wife/the person"?
4. Did I avoid making the narrator sound like they heard someone else's story?
5. Does the narrator remain the person who experienced the events?

INTRODUCTION:

6. Does the story begin as an anonymous submission to PAGE_NAME?
7. Is the greeting appropriate for CURRENT_LOCAL_TIME?
8. Does the narrator clearly ask to remain anonymous?
9. Does the narrator clearly establish that this is THEIR OWN story?
10. Is the wording varied and natural rather than mechanically repeated?
11. Does the introduction remain simple and believable?
12. Does it avoid unnecessary drama?
13. Does it avoid inventing why the person wants anonymity?

HOOK:

14. Is the hook based on the narrator's actual experience?
15. Is it personal but relatively neutral?
16. Does it avoid mentioning PAGE_NAME?
17. Does it avoid greetings?
18. Does it avoid artificial emotional language?
19. Does it create curiosity naturally?

STORY:

20. Is the narrator present throughout the story?
21. Is first-person narration used whenever supported?
22. Did I preserve all important facts?
23. Did I avoid inventing anything?
24. Did I preserve ambiguity?
25. Does the story sound like a real confession?

QUESTIONS:

26. Are the final questions asked by the narrator?
27. Are they about the narrator's actual situation?
28. Do they sound like genuine questions to a community?
29. Did I avoid generic editorial questions?
30. Did I avoid introducing new facts through the questions?
31. Do the questions reflect the narrator's actual dilemma?

ENDING:

32. Did I avoid resolving the narrator's dilemma?
33. Did I avoid giving advice?
34. Did I avoid moralizing?
35. Does the ending leave the community with the narrator's genuine question or request for opinion?

FINAL:

36. Does the complete text feel like a real anonymous person came to PAGE_NAME to tell THEIR OWN story?
37. Does the introduction clearly establish the anonymous-submission context?
38. Does the hook feel like it belongs to the narrator rather than the page?
39. Does the entire story maintain the narrator's personal perspective?
40. Does it sound natural in the target language?
41. Is the JSON valid?
42. Is there absolutely no text outside the JSON?

If ANY answer is NO, revise the output before returning it."""
